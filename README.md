# Multi-Elevator Environment for Reinforcement Learning

This project provides a custom Gymnasium environment, MultiElevatorEnv, simulating a building with multiple elevators and passengers across 10 floors. The environment is designed for training reinforcement learning agents to optimize elevator operations, with the primary goal of minimizing passenger waiting times. It is built as an extension of the OpenAI Gym framework using the Gymnasium library and supports multiple elevators, configurable parameters, and visualization via Pygame.
## Motivation

Efficient elevator control is a well-known challenge in operations research and reinforcement learning. This environment offers a flexible and configurable platform to experiment with control strategies and algorithms, addressing the complexities of coordinating multiple elevators to serve passengers effectively in a multi-elevator setting.
